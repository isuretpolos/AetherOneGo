# What is Radionics?
Radionics is a mechanized ritual of inner alchemy. Where the ancient initiate used meditation, symbols, elements, and ritual to purify and direct forces through the soul, the radionic operator uses devices that simulate and amplify this process.

In truth, the power lies not in the device, but in the consciousness of the operator—a core teaching of both Hermetic and alchemical traditions. The device is like the alembic or retort in laboratory alchemy: a tool for holding energy and intention while the true transformation occurs within.

In sum, radionics represents a contemporary vehicle for Hermetic manipulation of reality through will and vibration. It reflects the same worldview as the ancient alchemists held:

* That spirit and matter are one
* That mind governs form
* That symbols, frequencies, and intention are the levers of creation

Whether with a symbol or a dial, the true alchemist or radionic practitioner is one who understands the laws of the unseen—and shapes reality accordingly.

# Alchemical Correspondences

Radionics is best interpreted as a technological form of inner alchemy—a blend of psychic influence, symbolic transformation, and energetic tuning. Here's how it aligns with core alchemical principles:

1. **Mental Transmutation**

In alchemy, the first great work is transmutation—not of base metals into gold, but of the base self into a higher state of consciousness. Radionics mirrors this by using **thought-forms and intention** as the **primary agents of transformation**. The dial settings or symbolic patterns represent mental archetypes—just as in alchemy, **symbols encode transformation**.

Radionics operates on the same mental plane where vibration, frequency, and form converge. This aligns with the Hermetic law of Mentalism: “*The All is Mind*.” Radionic devices are physical extensions of the operator’s focused will, just as the Philosopher’s Stone is a metaphor for perfected consciousness.

2. **Tuning and Resonance**

In both alchemy and radionics, resonance is central. Alchemists believed in sympathetic resonance—when two things vibrate in harmony, one can influence the other. This is the basis for working with planetary correspondences, metals, and stones.

Radionic “rates” or frequencies correspond to this idea: by identifying the energetic signature of a *thing* (a plant or a quality), and tuning to that, the practitioner can *cause change at a distance*. It’s the esoteric science of harmony—the same knowledge ancient alchemists applied using planetary metals or elixirs.

3. **The Witness and the Microcosm**
   
In radionics, a small sample of a subject—called a witness—can represent the whole person. This is a clear application of the Hermetic law of correspondence: the microcosm reflects the macrocosm. In alchemy, this is why a drop of mercury could hold celestial forces, or why a human being was seen as a mirror of the universe.

Just as an alchemist might work on a small piece of matter to influence greater reality, the radionic operator works with a witness (which could be just the name) to influence the whole.

4. **Sacred Geometry and Symbolism**
   
Radionic machines often use geometric figures—like yantras, mandalas, or circuit boards not unlike sigils. These are alchemical in their symbolic power: tools that encode divine archetypes and allow the operator to bridge spirit and matter.

This is akin to the Emerald Tablets’ descriptions of geometric power and the use of sacred forms to channel higher forces. Alchemy has always taught that form has power, and that symbols are living gates.
